# oreilly_books
A script i made to keep my Oreilly books account active since it times out due to inactivity

Make sure you run the setup script using ```./setup.sh```. The setup script will set yo up a virtual environment, ask for your Oreilly credentials, then set you up a cron to run weekly in firefox headless mode.
