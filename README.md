A script i made to keep my Oreilly books account active since it times out due to inactivity

Make sure you run the setup script using ```./setup.sh```. The setup script will set yo up a virtual environment, ask for your Oreilly credentials, then set you up a cron to run weekly in firefox headless mode.\

**Update 02OCT** OreillY included a SSO option for military emails now so the sscript is updated to reflect that change and still use passwords, if you're using a non, military account there may be issues.
